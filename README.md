# README

Private Events project done with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/private-events)

## Objectives

* Put in to practice more advanced Active Record Queries and Associations
* Get my hands dirty with many to many associations
* Find out if the stuff I have written down on my paper is actually sound model architecture for this project
* Get more comfortable with Rails in general

## Reflection

* Learned a ton about through associations.
* Spent a long time working on when to use includes to eager and pre load table. I still feel pretty weak on this, but it is making a lot more sense than it did before I started.
* Feeling a lot more comfortable setting up basic associations and views and migrations and everything
* Put collections into practice for the first time

## To Do
* Style when learning html and css more in-depth
* Delete events when a user is deleted
* More separation about past and future events
* More event-y type stuff, perhaps public events that require invitation
* Add invite to public events in general? Specifics below.
* Revamp invite system so if there are many users they don't all show up.
* Allow event creator to manage attendees. Block someone from attending event.
* Allow event creators to allow guests to invite other or promote other users to admins of the event
